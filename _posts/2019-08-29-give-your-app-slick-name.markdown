Have you ever struggled with naming your new OSS project or web app? While hoping no one claimed your desired one in GitHub, npm, Homebrew, PyPI, Domains, etcetera, choosing the best name is weary work.

That's why I created [namae](https://namae.dev).

# namae

[namae](https://namae.dev) is an inter-platform name availability checker for developers and entrepreneurs.

Once you fill out a form with a name you want to use, namae will check through various registries and check if the name is already in use or not.
