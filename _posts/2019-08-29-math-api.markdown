title: 'Math API: LaTeX Math as SVG image'

I've always wanted to put LaTeX Math equations on a web page where MathJax is not allowed to run inside it.

Spending some time, I made [Math API](https://math.now.sh), that renders LaTeX Math markup into an SVG image.

So you can place your equation on almost everywhere on which you could put `<img>` or Markdown (`![]()`), such as GitHub, Jupyter Notebook or dev.to (here!).


```markdown
![](https://math.now.sh?from=\\LaTeX)
```

![](https://math.now.sh?from=\\LaTeX)


```markdown
![](https://math.now.sh?from=\\log\\prod^N_{i}x_{i}=\\sum^N_i\\log{x_i})
```

![](https://math.now.sh?from=\\log\\prod^N_{i}x_{i}=\\sum^N_i\\log{x_i})


# Inline image

It is possible to generate an inline equation by changing the query from `from` to `inline`.

```markdown
<img src="https://math.now.sh?inline=\\LaTeX" />
```

# Online Editor

Also, there is the online editor available at https://math.now.sh.

# Conclusion

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/uetchy/math-api).
