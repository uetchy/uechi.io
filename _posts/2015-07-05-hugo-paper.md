When I created my blog, there are no well simplified [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) theme around the world. I need to a theme that just don't interrupt reading experience. [Hugo Paper](https://github.com/uetchy/hugo-paper) is made for that.

# How to integrate

Just run following oneliner and you will be ready to start using Hugo Paper.

```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/uetchy/hugo-paper.git themes/hugo-paper && git submodule update
```
