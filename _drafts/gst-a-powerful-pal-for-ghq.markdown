[gst](https://github.com/uetchy/gst) is tiny and simple but powerful pal for [ghq](https://github.com/motemen/ghq).

Have you ever imagined what if you know which commits are unpushed or which changes are uncommitted yet, for all of the repositories you have cloned on your machine?

You might want to check out my ongoing project `gst`:
it might help you to know what ongoing changes are remained to be committed or pushed among entire your local repositories.
